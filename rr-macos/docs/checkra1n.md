# checkra1n Guide

__**Get a USB Type A (male) to Lightning (male) cable. Type C cables will not work. If you only have Type C ports on your Mac, get a Type C to Type A adapter, and then plug the Type A cable into that. **__

* Ensure it is high quality, and in the best case, ensure it is made by Apple.
* Check the cable for fraying, exposed shielding, or other damage. 
* Checkra1n is both cable-sensitive and device-sensitive, as well as time-sensitive.
* **iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus need their passcodes removed, and the A11 BPR check skipped. **

**It will put your phone into Recovery Mode. This is normal. **

You will need to press the indicated buttons in perfect timing with the onscreen timers. These buttons and times vary by device.

Once completed, open the "checkra1n" app that has appeared. Install Cydia with it.
