## Warnings before you begin

* If you downloaded a .ipa file from a website, got it from a friend, or otherwise recieved it from any source other than your own device, do not complete this tutorial, and delete the file. Modified .ipa files are dangerous, and hard to detect.
* This tutorial will take over an hour for first-time users. Be aware of your own skill level, and do not rush this tutorial, as you may accidentally miss crucial steps.
* Read the guide in its entirety before beginning, as you should be at least familiar with the process first.
