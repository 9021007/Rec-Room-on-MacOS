Enter your account password.

> Entering your Apple ID account password into some app you downloaded off the internet while following a guide is not something I would normally recommend doing, but it is necessary to continue.

If you use 2 factor authentication, you might need to generate an [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397) to use in place of your regular password.

If it fails anyway, try toggling Anisette authentication.

After installation completes, see the [Launch guide](launch.md).
